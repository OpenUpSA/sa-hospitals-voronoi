# South African Hospitals Survey 2011-2012 Voronoi map
A Voronoi map of South African hospitals, clinics, and other health care centres. Coordinates obtained from the [South African Hospitals Survey 2011-2012](https://data.code4sa.org/Health/South-African-Hospitals-Survey-2011-2012/ft5b-smjr).

If you want to understand the basics of how this works, I suggest reading [Chris Zetter's blog post](https://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/15/building-a-voronoi-map-with-d3-and-leaflet/) which I used to create this map.

## Contribute

Contribution are _extremely_ welcome. There are many ways this tool can be improved:

- Add a search box so users can search by address
- Use a more recent dataset
- Use a more complete dataset which includes non-public facilities, which I believe are (mostly) missing
- Clean up the current dataset - a few facilities are in the ocean, Lesotho, Swaziland
- Add data to the current dataset - many facilities don't have a phone number, properly formatted physical address, email address, etc
